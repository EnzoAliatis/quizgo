## What is QuizGo?

A simplistic quiz built with Go to run on the Command Line (Terminal).

The goal of the project is to get myself acquainted with Golang and provide opportunities for other Golang developers to contribute to Open Source Project.

My vision for the project is to implement more and more features into the Quiz app and at the same time keeping it modular enough. Keeping the code modular will help us migrate it to other platforms as well.

## Install

1. Installing Go on your system: [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-ubuntu-18-04) | [Windows](https://golang.org/doc/install)

2. Once Go is successfully installed, type in the following command: ```go get github.com/zerefwayne/quizgo```

3. Type ```go run main.go```

4. As of now, the quiz shall start automatically on the terminal itself.
